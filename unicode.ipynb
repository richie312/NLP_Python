    "Unicode supports over million character. Each character is assigned a number (also known as code point). In python those number are written in the format of \\uxxxx (four digit hexadecimal point) form.This unicode when saved in file they must be encoded as stream of bytes. ASCII and latin-2 forms of encoding uses single byte per code point.Therefore it can only use small subset of unicode. where as UTF-8 uses multiple bytes for encoding for each code point and can represents the full layers of unicode characters.\n",
